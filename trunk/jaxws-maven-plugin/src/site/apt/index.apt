JAX-WS Maven Plugin

  This plugin contains Maven adapter for {{{http://jax-ws.java.net/}JAX-WS}}'s
  toolset. The original version of this was developed in the codehaus mojo project,
  but as of March 2007, the project is moved to jax-ws-commons.

* Usage
  
  Instructions on how to use the JAX-WS Maven Plugin can be found {{{usage.html}here}}.
  
* Goals Overview
  
  * {{{wsimport-mojo.html}jaxws:wsimport}}: generates JAX-WS portable artifacts used in JAX-WS 
     clients and services. The tool reads a WSDL and generates all the required artifacts 
     for web service development, deployment, and invocation. 
  
  * {{{wsimport-test-mojo.html}jaxws:wsimport-test}}: same as <<<jaxws:wsimport>>> but for tests.

  * {{{wsgen-mojo.html}jaxws:wsgen}}: reads a service endpoint implementation class 
     and generates all of the portable artifacts for a JAX-WS web service.

  * {{{wsgen-test-mojo.html}jaxws:wsgen-test}}: same as <<<jaxws:wsgen>>> but for tests.
